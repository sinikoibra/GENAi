This charge will continue to be levied for every payment cycle until the MAD is cleared.    Is the Rs. 4,999 Annual Fee Justified?    SBI Elite Credit Card charges an annual fee of Rs. 4,999 which makes it a bit costly one to have. However it is true to say that the annual fee is itself reversed in the form of welcome vouchers of Rs. 5,000 that the card offers. Overall, when compared with the benefits that it offers, the fee is justified. SBI Card has also set a fee waiver condition of reaching the spending milestone of Rs. 10 Lakh in a year which might seem too high for the cardholders.  SBI Elite Credit Card is surely for the elite segment and if you are someone who would like to avail premium privileges, put high spends on the card and are willing\\\\xa0 to pay a high annual fee for it, then this card is perfect for you.

SBI Elite Credit Card would be best suited for the people who are heavy spenders and want an all-rounder card, even if it carries a high annual fee. The rewards rate on the card is not that great but satisfactory. However, the card offers decent travel benefits to the users, hence it is definitely a good travel credit card. In terms of hotel rewards, the card offers cardholders a 10% discount on top of a 2.50% rewards rate (10 points per Rs. 100, 1 point = Rs. 0.25) at participating Trident hotels.\\\\xa0 Additionally, cardholders purchasing Vistara Airlines tickets will earn 2.25% rewards rate (9 points per Rs. 100, 1 point = Rs. 0.25) on their bookings. These hotel and flight booking rates allow cardholders to earn great rewards on all their travels.  Though the card offers decent opportunities to earn the rewards, the redemption choices are not hassle-free. The conventional rewards catalogue may not attract a lot of customers. There is a cashback option but in 4:1 ratio which is again not a very good deal.  Moreover, the Priority Pass Membership is only valid for 2 years after which you will have to pay $99 to continue the membership in order to enjoy the 6 complimentary lounge visits in a year. Though the first-year fee is returned in the form of welcome e-vouchers, the brand options are very limited. Also, the annual fee waiver condition of Rs. 10 lakh spend is high.  At the end, SBI Elite Credit Card would suit the needs of a frequent traveler and a heavy spender.     Should get this card if  Consider other options if      You put most of the expenses on your credit card every month  You go out for movies and dining many times in a month  You travel abroad frequently and would take multiple trips in a year  You prefer staying in luxury hotels      You are looking for a credit card with great reward offerings  You are not ready to pay an annual fee of Rs. 4,999 or would not be able to get the maximum out of your card  You are not a frequent traveller  You do not shop from any of brands listed in the welcome voucher category       Check the list of top SBI Credit Cards (https://www.paisabazaar.com/sbi-bank/credit-card/) across different categories.
